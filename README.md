# SQL-DATA_WAREHOUSE-PROJECT
building data ware house
SQL Data Warehouse Project
Overview
This project demonstrates the complete design and implementation of a SQL-based Data Warehouse using a multi-layer architecture — Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
It integrates data from CRM and ERP systems, performs data cleaning and transformation, and enables analytical insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Advanced Data Analysis (ADA).

Architecture Overview
1. Bronze Layer – Raw Data
The Bronze layer stores raw data directly from the source systems. It preserves the original format for traceability and ensures no information is lost during ingestion.

Sources:

CRM System – Customer, product, and sales data
Files: cust_info.xlsx, prd_info.xlsx, sales_details.xlsx
ERP System – Customer, location, and category data
Files: CUST_AZ12.xlsx, LOC_A101.xlsx, PX_CAT_G1V2.xlsx
2. Silver Layer – Cleaned and Transformed Data
The Silver layer contains cleaned and standardized data from the Bronze layer, ready for further processing and analysis.

Key Steps:

Removed duplicates and null values
Standardized column names and formats
Handled missing and inconsistent data
Created logical relationships between CRM and ERP tables
Main Tables:

crm_cust_info
crm_prd_info
crm_sales_details
erp_cust_az12
erp_loc_a101
erp_px_cat_g1v2
3. Gold Layer – Analytical Data
The Gold layer includes the analytical models used for reporting and business analysis.
Dimension and fact tables are designed for efficient querying and visualization.

Views Created:

gold.dim_customers – Customer demographic and location details
gold.dim_products – Product category and pricing information
gold.fact_sales – Central fact table containing transactional sales data
Data Flow Summary
Source Data → Bronze Layer → Silver Layer → Gold Layer → Analytics

Each layer adds value:

Bronze: Raw data ingestion
Silver: Data cleaning and transformation
Gold: Analytical modeling and insights
SQL Implementation
This project is implemented entirely in T-SQL, including schema design, table creation, data transformation, and analytical view creation.

Highlights:

Created separate schemas (silver, gold) for modular organization
Defined tables for CRM and ERP systems
Built analytical views with JOIN and ROW_NUMBER() functions
Verified relationships between dimensions and facts
Script file:
SQL_DataWarehouse_Project.sql
